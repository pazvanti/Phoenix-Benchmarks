Benchmarks for the Phoenix Template engine

### What is Phoenix

Phoenix aims to be a modern template engine that will facilitate development of complex web application by providing an ease to use and easy to understand syntax for developing the HTML pages that will be rendered by the backend. Phoenix uses Server-Side-Rendering (SSR) to speed webpage load times and to provide close integration between the front-end and the back-end of a web application.

Phoenix provides many advantages compared to other template engines that are currently available for Spring/Spring Boot and introduces new features that are not currently available elsewhere.

Only one special character @ which separates HTML code from the programmable part of the template
The ability to use Java in the template. No need to learn a new syntax, language or utilities. You can use the language you already know and love
Fragments and component-based development. Create reusable components which you can reference between templates
Reverse routing for Spring. You can change the URL of a web-page without the need to modify your template files. Phoenix will compute the URLs at runtime based on existing controllers
Lighting fast and lightweight. Phoenix is orders of magnitude faster than Thymeleaf for rendering pages. This is achieved by compiling the template files, instead of interpreting them. See the benchmarks below.
